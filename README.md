# HTAN_Shiny
## Data Ingest Shiny App

Currently shows a scRNAseq metadata template link on google sheets, then allows for a csv upload and validation based on that file. 

To-Do:
- link to synapse project and show project and folder

- option to get previously uploaded manifest
- progress bar for upload
- reactive based on assay input (when we have more templates)
- show/hide buttons consecutively
